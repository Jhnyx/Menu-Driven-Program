# Menu Driven Program
 
Are you tired of manually managing your data structures? Say no more! I have just the tool you need to make your life easier.

Introducing my program, developed by yours truly, John Onyx Abcede for my CPE 221 final project. With its user-friendly interface, you can easily manage and manipulate various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Want to insert a new data element? No problem! Need to delete an old one? Easy as pie! Looking to modify existing elements? Piece of cake!

With just a few clicks, you can perform all sorts of operations, from searching to modifying, and everything in between. So sit back, relax, and let my program do all the heavy lifting. You'll wonder how you ever managed without it! Navigate the MENU BAR at your left, and let's start managing those data structures like a pro!
